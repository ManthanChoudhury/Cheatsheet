  ## Docker
 
 ### Introduction
 
 - Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and therefore use fewer resources than virtual machines.

 - The service has both free and premium tiers. The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine It was first started in 2013 and is developed by Docker.
